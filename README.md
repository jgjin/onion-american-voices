<p> A short, fun personal project which I wrote to not waste time as I waste time. </p>

<p> Written in Python, parse.py and visit.py require a Python interpreter to run. parse.py and visit.py were tested with Python 2.7, though they should also be compatible with Python 3. </p>

<p> parse.py relies on the Requests Python library to retrieve search results for American Voices articles. </p>
